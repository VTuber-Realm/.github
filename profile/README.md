# Projects ü§ñ
Here is our future project plans that are all pretty exciting and think will help the VTuber world! Most of these are being led by [@Mieko Hikari](https://github.com/MiekoHikari) but everyone is open to contribute aslong as they follow each repo's respective rules! Each project has its actual name and it's used name in () to differentiate the development and production environment in a fun way (for me).
## WIP!

# Open Source Contributions ‚úçÔ∏è
Everyone is free to contribute to the repos we have to offer aslong as you follow their respective rules! All new implementations require an approval from all VTA Staff so if it takes longer than usual to accept your changes, don't fret!
